          <h4>Refunds And Return</h4>
          <p>
            we offer customer a 30 days refund policy.A cancellation occurs when
            a consumer returns an item purchased on an e-commerce website. This
            could be due to poor quality or faulty product products that do not
            meet the requirements as advertised on the website at the time of
            purchase, or it could be that the customer found the same product
            with the same quality for a lower price elsewhere. A refund policy
            of an E-commerce platform states that if a consumer is unhappy with
            a product or service, they will return it and receive a refund for
            the amount paid at the time of purchase. In certain situations, the
            consumer has a time period beyond which they cannot return the
            product, such as 30 days or 5 weeks  from the date of delivery.
